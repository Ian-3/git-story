Prompt: At the age of 18 everyone gets teleported into a small room. In front of you is a table with all kinds of meals from apples to gourmet meats. 
Whatever you take a bite of will determine what superpower you'll get. You are the first person to take a bite of the table itself.

Breinleigh walked over to the giant ugly table and said "Omg you're so ugly, I'm going to eat you." She laughed and it was the nasty kind of laugh that makes you think they're not actually laughing, the kind of laugh that sounds like a crusty mummy exhaling after being brought to life. She began knawing on the table and didn't even care when her teeth began bleeding and falling out. After a few minutes of gnawing, she began transforming into Kim Kardashian. Breinleigh looked at herself in a little compaxt mirror with the words "Live, Laugh, Love" engraved into it and shrieked when she realized what had happened. She was wailing about this transformation when she noticed that the table began transforming into her, or at least her old self.

The table began to attack Breinleigh, violently hitting her with a valentino white bag. However, she fought back, using her newfound Kardshian powers. She slashed the table with her nails, whipped with her long pony tail, and bumped with her hips that don't lie. The table was on the floor, knocked out from the impact of Kim hips, and Breinleigh didn't waste any time making a run for the door. She ran out the door and through a very long hallway, going as far as her heels would take her. But the table was on the move, running very quickly to Breinleigh. The table tackled her to the floor with a slam, and like that, Breinleigh was knocked out cold.
